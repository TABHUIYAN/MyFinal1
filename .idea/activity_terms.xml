     2. STRUCTURE OF THE dublinbikes SERVICE
     2.1 The Service consists of a network of stations (“the station(s)”), each comprising a central terminal (“the terminal”) and attachment stands (“the stand(s)”) for the bikes providing The Service. Please note that it cannot be guaranteed that at any given time a particular station will have either bikes or vacant stands available. 2.2 For short term subscribers to The Service, a credit card enabled terminal allows them to buy a 3 Day Ticket for use of The Service by means of an automated electronic payment screen and keypad. All terminals enable a subscriber to: - select a bike and to obtain an extra 15 minutes of free use if on   returning the bike, the station is fully occupied. - consult the occupancy status of nearby stations. - obtain information about The Service. For annual subscribers to The Service, a terminal also allows them to: - log in and select a bike using a screen, a keypad and a smart card   reader. - access their recent rental charges account information. 2.3 Each stand accommodates one bike and is numbered for the purposes of identifying and selecting a bike. 3. AVAILABILITY OF THE dublinbikes SERVICE 3.1 In order to access The Service, the subscriber must be in possession of a 3 Day Ticket, an Annual Card or an associated smart card (e.g. Leap Card). The pricing structure is set out in Clause 6. 3.2 The 3 Day Ticket is valid for a maximum of three consecutive days, running from the moment the operation is accepted by the bank of the credit card holder. 3.3 The Annual Card is valid for a period of one year and is renewed automatically unless cancelled. Not to Renew (NTR) requests are only
    accepted in writing or via the website dublinbikes.ie prior to the renewal date.

    3.4.1 During the validity period, the subscriber may only use The Service for a maximum of 24 consecutive hours

     3.4.2 Subject to the number of bikes available at each station, The Service is accessible twelve months a year, seven days a week between the hours of 5am and 12.30am, without interruption, except in cases of force majeure, operational reasons or a change in law affecting The Service. In this context, a change in law includes, without limitation, a change in law by virtue of Common Law, Statute, Statutory Instrument, Proclamation, Bye-law, Directive, Decision, Regulation, Rule, Order, Notice, Code of Practice, Code of Conduct, Rule of Court, Instruments, or delegated or subordinate legislation. 3.4.3 The City and The Provider reserve the right to refuse or suspend access to the scheme without refund. 4.

   by charging the credit card used to take out the subscription, under the conditions set out in Clause 4. The total amount due,
    including the subscription charge and any rental charges incurred over the validity period, will be debited in a single operation in the five
    working days following the expiry of the subscription. (4) For Annual Cards, payment of the amount due by the subscriber is made by either
    credit/debit card or direct debit. In the case of credit/debit cards, the subscription charge is debited at the time of subscription.
    Direct debit subscribers will have their subscription debited after the subscription is confirmed. Rental charges incurred will be debited at the end of each month,
    either from the subscriber credit/debit card or by direct debit. When subscribers update their credit/debit card details, their card provider may apply
    a preauthorisation fee, usually €2, in order to validate the card. This is a preauthorisation which is released within a few days and is not a charge.
    Failure to update credit/debit card details in good time may result in a temporary loss of service. In order to access The Service,
     the Subscriber must maintain a method of payment at all times which meets The Provider's requirements including Visa Verify or MasterCard Secure Code where appropriate.
